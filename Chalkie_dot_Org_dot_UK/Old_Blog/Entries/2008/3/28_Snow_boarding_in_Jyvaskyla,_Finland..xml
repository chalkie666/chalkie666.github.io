    <richText>Still in Finland, I got chance to go snowboarding on the fresh powder deposited in the snow storm the preceding tuesday. The sun was very much out, temperature at exactly 0 deg C, perfect conditions, no spills, and even managed to catch a little air (no rails or none of that nonsense though). Klaus and I managed to get quite a few runs in, and followed up with an open fire to cook the local vegetable, makkara (&#x201C;sausage&#x201D;), with his little &#x2018;uns. Fantastic!&#xD;&#xD;Easter was spent at Wes and Suvi&#x2019;s cottage in the Lartamo realm just west of Helsinki. Water was fetched from the well, trees were chopped and stacked into bunable portions, and most importantly, the annual long drop toilet poo burial ritual was performed with a minimum of fuss, mess and bad smells (it was still frozen). Ahh, the joys of the country cottage life. I&#x2019;ll be back as soon as I can...</richText>
