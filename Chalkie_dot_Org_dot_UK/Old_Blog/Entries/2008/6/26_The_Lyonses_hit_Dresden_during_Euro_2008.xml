    <richText>Euro 2008 is upon us, and Germany are doing pretty well. Let&#x2019;s not mention England - cough. Abby and Dave came to visit with their scooter racing tots in tow, and we hung out with Dave&#x2019;s brother Keith and his wife Martina, and Grandma Lyons and Gwen (Keith also lives here in Dresden, after coming back from China to be with the wife and kid. I met them all first when we all lived in Rochester MN, and played in bands). One evening we were in the park with the kids while a game was on, and it was all very quiet, not a soul in sight... all watching the game on TV. &#xD;&#xD;Well, quiet until germany scored, then a very odd sound made us all jump. Several thousand people indoors making the same cheering noise at the exact same time makes for unusually startling listening outside. </richText>
