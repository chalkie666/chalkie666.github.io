    <richText>I started a new job this week in Dresden, Germany. At the Max Planck Institute - CBG to be exact. Suzie dropped in from France last weekend to help me settle in, and we had a look around town, aided by an underpowered and comical looking hired fiat panda. Despite having visited twice before, I was very pleasantly surprised to find the old town area Aldstadt full of fantastic old architecture. Much rebuilt after the war and it&#x2019;s firebombing campaign, in particular the church which cost 130 million to fix up back to the original state. All very nice. Then there&#x2019;s the Neustadt, where all the punks and hippies, students and other odd folk live. Think I&#x2019;ll get a flat there, amidst the bars, restaurants and clubs. Quite the &#x201C;happening&#x201D; place apparently, lots of music and other arts. </richText>
