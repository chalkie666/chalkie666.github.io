    <richText>I just got back from the IEEE ISBE 08 conference in Paris. 1st time I ever visited the french capital, and very nice it was too. I was impressed by their efforts to remove all the dog poo that famously carpets their streets, with an ingenious street irrigation system. I never got mucky shoes once!&#xD;&#xD;Wednesday morning I went for a walk up to Notre Dame and took a few photos. Didn&#x2019;t spot Quasimodo swinging from the bell tower, but that disappointment was allayed by the beauty of the architecture and gardens. Everyone likes a well constructed flying buttress. &#xD;&#xD;The weather was a bit erratic, and I had to resort to my bike anorak at one point, which looked very chic in combination with my shorts, sock and sandals. Who says I&#x2019;ve got no fashion sense? The food was very nice indeed. &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;</richText>
