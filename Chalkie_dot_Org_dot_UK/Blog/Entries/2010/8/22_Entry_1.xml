    <richText>We just got back from a week of snorkeling and eating fried cheese in Corfu, which was very relaxing and warm. Much de-stressed and very happy with that. &#xD;&#xD;Holiday Tip: &#xD;Don&#x2019;t go snorkeling with your lady friend's compact digital camera in your pocket. You might be able to rescue the photos off the memory card (we did thanks to Silke&#x2019;s bro Christian and some contact cleaner) but the camera will be toast (yes, It was... i took it apart and it was full of corrosion... totally boned). &#xD;&#xD;For more photos, click on the photo above or Corfu 2010 at the top of the page.</richText>
