    <richText>Good work fella! This guy realised that the only way to get people out of poverty is to give them the fiscal freedom to do it for themselves. Micro loans, just a few quid with a sensible interest rate, instead of having to rely on unscrupulous loan sharks with extortionate rates, has given millions in south asia chance at a life out of poverty by starting up their own businesses, often as small community cooperatives. It actually works, and people pay back the loans so they can then borrow larger sums to develop things further. The banks wouldn&#x2019;t lend to poor people and women bacuse they have no &#x201C;collateral&#x201D;, so he set up a bank that would, realising that people are themselves collateral. A bit more radical thinking like that in the world, and it would be a much less miserable place for many millions of the poorest people. That would mean less political instability, fewer wars, and very probably less terrorism. It would be more like Finland everywhere, which, apart from the weather here at the moment, would be a &#x201C;good thing&#x201D;. People who are given the chance to make a decent living don&#x2019;t grow opium poppies or start civil wars etc. Seems obvious really. &#xD;&#xD;Still no snow here...</richText>
