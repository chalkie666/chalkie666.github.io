                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">'Bunnies' is a drinking game enjoyed at universities, especially by their sports clubs, throughout the British Isles, and indeed all over the world. After many years of evolution since its creation (in the dim and distant past of all male halls of residence, eating fully gowned while in hall refectories, hockey being played on grass and such other now archaic practices), this pillar of British university tradition remains alive to this day as a vital part of a good social life.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">The main functions of the game are to bring together the members of sports teams and instill in them a tremendous team spirit, to aid in the consumption of alcoholic beverages and, importantly, to introduce and test the abilities, mental and physical, of each year's crop of fresh faced, bushy tailed freshers(1).<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">In order to play this entertaining and skillful game of logic and speed you will need the following:<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">•A pint of beer each. No halves, shorts, alcopops, wine, soft drinks, etc. Cider is acceptable but rather careless, whereas snakebite and black (a combination of cider, lager and blackcurrant) is just asking for trouble.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">•A minimum of four players (or three real and one virtual player, see 'Pete Best' below), or preferably the rest of the team you play for. Alternatively several other 'real' friends could join in, however they are more likely to refuse to play properly due to inadequate peer pressure. No more than 14 players is recommended.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">•A table or other space around which there is room for you all to sit, facing each other in a circle.<br /></p>

                <p class="Body">Instead of the simple start described above, Mr Chairman may elect another player to start with a simple start, or with a simple start followed by a designated pass, which must be completed correctly by the designated starter. Also, Mr Chairman may start the game with one of several 'celebrity starts'. These are a series of vocalisations and actions inserted before the thigh slap, and after the hover, and are imitated by the rest of the players. The intention of celebrity starts is to attract the attention of other persons minding their own business in the bar/saloon. This may have one of two outcomes:<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">•Attraction of more players into the game.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">•Ejection from the premises.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">An example of a popular celebrity start is 'Ben Johnson Bunnies', named after the infamous Canadian sprinter, banned for taking performance-enhancing drugs. The players all mime injecting steroids into their arms, sprint for 10 seconds on the spot while counting down from ten to zero as loudly as possible. This is followed by them pretending they are standing on the medals podium, reluctantly removing their gold medal from around their necks and handing it to the person to their left.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">There are many of these celebrity starts. Other examples include the 'Hawaii 5-0', 'Nikki Lauda', 'Ayrton Senna', 'Manchester University Hockey Girls Warm Up' and 'JFK assassination' starts and many non politically correct others, the mimes for which can be left to your imagination.<br /></p>

When the bunny is passed, the player having the bunny transfers possession of the bunny to another player, who must recognise that he is the recipient of the bunny and then 'take' possession of the bunny, by putting his thumbs to his temples and waggling his 'bunny ears'. Of course, the players on either side of the new possessor of the bunny must 'mirror' the bunny. The player who has 'passed the bunny' must fully remove his thumb(s) from his temples for the pass to be legitimate and must not spuriously regain possession of the bunny before it is passed to him again. The players who were mirroring the bunny of a player who has passed it must also remove their thumb from their temple and cease to mirror. Failure to adhere to these rules or any other will result in the player getting 'fined' at the end of the round. These fines are usually liquid and alcoholic resulting in the intoxication of the players, which of course is the real object of the game.</p>

To demonstrate a new pass, Mr Chairman will call the hover, then take a virtual bunny and demonstrate the pass with the assistance of appropriate mirroring. Passes must be performed in the exact manner in which they are demonstrated, without any hint of ambiguity or confusion.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Passes introduced before previous rounds of bunnies are still valid and do not need to be repeatedly introduced and demonstrated before each round. People who are not present during the introduction of a new pass (perhaps having issued a 'trunk call' in order to buy another beverage, see below) must not be informed that the new pass is in effect (a good way to stitch up freshers).

Players stalling their passes, not giving quick decisive passes, languishing in possession of the bunny intentionally or otherwise just not getting on with it will be fined at the end of the round. This rule is vital to the essence of bunnies, affording the game play a requirement for quick thinking, high levels of concentration, and deft elegant passing. Experienced players will often start the game with Olympic speed already in force in an effort to further hone their bunnies skills and make the game harder. A competent game of bunnies should be played at such a pace that the casual observer is rendered mesmerised by the velocity of the action. Most commonly, American observers will be overheard expressing bemusement and disbelief at what they are seeing.

While standing on a chair or table, the guilty player must consume eight digits (see 'Mr Weights and Measures' below) A digit is the amount of liquid it takes to bring the water-level up to the position of the lowest finger on the glass while rotating on the spot, with contributions to fill his vessel from other players if needed. This most disgusting of bunnies offenses must never go unpunished. Repeat offenders are likely to be ejected for the game and have to live in shame for the rest of their pitiful university careers, if not their remaining, hopefully short, life.

The bunny can be reversed only during the course of a pass. A player cannot reverse it by himself for himself. The bunny can only be reversed by the player making the pass, and never by the player receiving the pass. In order to reverse the bunny, a 'simple pass' is modified such that the arms cross over themselves, but still point at the intended recipient. This is a 'Reversed Throw'. Once this pass is made, the player receiving the reversed throw takes the bunny in a reversed manner - the left thumb is paced on the right temple and vice versa, with the palms facing backwards. Similarly the reverse bunny is reverse mirrored. For instance a player on the right of a reversed bunny will place his left thumb on his right temple, instead of the right thumb.<br /></p>

Thus, a reversed bunny thrown with a 'reversed throw' (with crossed arms) is picked up as a 'normal' bunny. However, if a reversed bunny is thrown with the arms straight and not crossed as a straight throw, the bunny remains reversed and must be picked up as a reversed bunny. All the other passes may be carried out with reverse modification as follows... For a reverse two man pass, the pass goes in the direction of the back of the hand not the palm. The same is true for the reverse three and four man passes. For the reverse three man pass the hand not on the nose is left in a reverse mirror like configuration. In the reverse four-man pass, the hand not on the nose is placed palm upwards on top of the head. A reverse cosmic pass is thrown in the direction of the back of the hand. A reversed bunny which is passed with one of the 'reversed' forms of a pass remains reversed, until the bunny is normalised with a 'reversed throw'.</p>

If this other player picks up the bunny, then he is in error, and will be fined at the end of the round. Also, the recipient of the Leeds pass to the left of the passing player may fall for the Loughbrough dummy and fail to pick up the Leeds pass coming form the passing player on his right.

His memory lives on as a virtual player who may be introduced at any time in the game. He is given a drink, a place in the circle (commonly between Mr Chairman and an unwitting fresher) in which nobody must sit, on threat of a heavy fine. Pete commands the utmost respect of all players. Any form of abuse, verbal or physical, directed at Pete will be fined in the most severe manner. Pete has a few peculiarities that must be accommodated for when he is present in the circle. Pete is always the best and fastest bunnies player in the circle. He always passes the bunny back to whoever passes it to him, but not always in the same manner in which it was passed to him. For instance, a player may pass to Pete with a simple pass, but almost instantaneously receive the bunny again from a Brammall Bounce pass from Pete, requiring the player to stand up to receive it correctly. Should any player issue a Brammal Bounce or any other pass that is picked up by the first player to get it, Pete, of course being the fastest, always gets it before anyone else, then passes it back again to the original passer. Pete is always up for going on away trips, especially in university competitions, and is a regular on many a team sheets. This Researcher included him in all of his team sheets as Captain of the UEA 1st XI field hockey team, which allowed the odd 'ringer' to join us on the pitch as required.<br /></p>

A recess is often called after a Cavalry Charge, in order to purchase more refreshments or to get on the bus and go home. A player issuing a Cavalry Charge with less than half a pint left is just trying to catch the other players out with a dummy charge. If any other player finishes their beverage by mistake by falling for this dummy, more fool them.<br /></p>

                <p class="Body">The Committee and Their Roles in Fining Players<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">To assist Mr Chairman in his fining duties and to keep certain other things in order, several committee members are appointed at the start of the game by Mr Chairman. Mr Chairman is a committee member and is governed by the same general rule as the rest of his committee. This general rule is: Double fines for committee members, so a fine that might usually be a two digit offense (such as failing to mirror the bunny) must be taken as four by a committee member. This rule keeps the standard of the committee high, as any player on the committee who is a poor bunnies player will quickly amass so many digits of beer in fines that he will become highly intoxicated and likely to vomit or pass out.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Referred to as 'Mr Chief Sneak', this player carefully watches the game play and points out infringements of the rules that Mr Chairman might have missed. He will be formally requested for 'Any other fines' by Mr Chairman at the end of each 'Round' of bunnies. Several Assistant chief sneaks may also be appointed if the circle is large. Most importantly, Mr Chief Sneak is responsible for ending each round of bunnies when play degenerates in to confusion or a player commits a heinous breach of the rules. Upon either of these happening he issues a call of 'Hold it right there!' while standing up and making a horizontal sweeping movement with his right arm. At this point, the round is ended and he may begin to assist Mr Chairman in issuing fines as appropriate.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Referred to as 'Mr Weights and Measures', this player determines the size of each fine as administered by Mr Chairman, who will often, but not always, suggest a size for the fine. Fines are delivered and paid in a number of 'digits'-worth of a beverage in a pint vessel. For instance, one participant (a fresher, say) makes the stupid mistake of falling for Mr Chairman's Loughbrough dummy. At the end of the round of bunnies, Mr Chairman points out the fine before he moves on to more important business. Mr Weights and Measures then instructs the fresher to consume two digits of beer. This entails the fresher picking up his vessel (with the appropriate hand(s), see 'chirality' below), and using the width of two of his digits as a measure from the surface level of the beverage. He then consumes from the vessel until the surface level of the beverage is at the bottom of his two digits. As a guide, a whole pint measures eight digits.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Mr Weights and Measures is also responsible for the Chirality of beverage consumption. This he determines with the use of a cigarette packet or other suitable object. At the start of the game, Mr Chairman instructs Mr Weights and Measures to show the players which hand they must consume with, depending on which way the box lies on the playing surface. For instance, standing on end is left-handed, on the side is right-handed, and flat on the large side is both hands. The portion of the box may be changed and any time by Mr Weights and Measures only. Players consuming with incorrect chirality are fined accordingly.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Referred to as 'Mr Thumb', this player, initially secretly appointed by Mr Chairman sometime into the game, can at any time place his right thumb on the upper playing surface. At this point the round of bunnies finishes, and all players continue to play at their own risk. The last player to realise the round had been interrupted by Mr Thumb by following his suit by also placing his right thumb on the playing surface, is the loser. He is fined four fingers. However, he may gamble double or quits on the call of a tossed coin. A new round of bunnies is started and the player who was last to get his right thumb on the table is now Mr Thumb, and may interrupt the game at any time, by placing his right thumb on the playing surface.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">It is, of course, illegal to inform a player verbally that Mr Thumb has interrupted the round. However, careful use of the elbow pointing technique and other non-verbal methods may be employed to inform one's friends of the interruption, such that an unwitting fresher gets the wrap. Use of the left thumb is a dummy, and any player following the dummy will be fined accordingly.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Similar in concept to Mr Thumb, 'Mr Nose' interrupts the game by placing his nose on the playing surface. The same rules apply as for Mr Thumb. Mr Nose may also place his nose on any available surface, such as another player's back, a nearby wall or door, a light fitting, the saloon etc. These variations are of doubtless humour, but should be exercised with extreme caution as they tend to be disruptive to the game and the continued presence of the players in that particular saloon, due to attracting unwanted attention from the saloon staff/bouncers.<br /></p>

                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Issues Regarding Names<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Females are fully permitted - and in fact should be actively encouraged - to play bunnies. They cannot, however, retain their female status during the game and must, like all the other players, assume a pseudonym. All names must be prefixed with 'Mr' and can be anything of the player's choice. Some of the more militant feminist players may resort to such silly names as 'Mr Ms'. This is absolutely fine and within their rights, of course. Mr Chairman may, however, overrule anyone's name due to them being a member of 'the committee' see below, or just because he doesn't like it. Mr Chairman will replace the name with one he deems more fitting. A female Chairperson is still called Mr Chairman.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Once the names of all the players have been decided and set by a round of names, where each player in turn gives his name such that all players can hear it, they may only be referred to by that name for the rest of the game. Failure to use the correct name may be fined at the discretion of Mr Chairman.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">At any point, Mr Chairman may instruct of the committee members to repeat the round of names, by saying out load the name of each player in the circle. Every name that the committee member fails to get right earns him a digit of beer as a fine. Names must be correctly correlated with the players to whom they belong. Attempting to get away with calling the freshers all Mr Fresher, and suchlike ruses are not acceptable.<br /></p>

                <p class="Body">Swearing or any other kind of crude language or verbal abuse is not permitted. Bunnies is a civilised, sociable, orderly, friendly and logical game. No room exists in the game for 'Speaking out of turn' in which a player vocalises to any other player or person outside the circle, unless he is a committee member or has been invited to speak by Mr Chairman.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">A player may attempt to attract the attention of Mr Chairman only with either a Trunk Call, or by raising his elbow (not his hand, since that would be considered very rude and result in a fine for pointing). Failure to adhere to this law of silence will quickly result in the disintegration of the game into very noisy, lawless anarchy. This state of affairs is generally considered to be 'Very Poor', and it is Mr Chairman's responsibility to keep noisy and easily distracted players minds focussed on the game by maintaining a continuum of flow in the game and repeatedly fining offenders.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Any kind of argument about fairness or dissatisfaction with allocation of fines is strictly prohibited. No pointing with index finger is allowed, as this is very rude indeed. Instead a player may bring attention to another player or himself by using the much less offensive elbow as a pointing tool.<br /></p>

                <p class="Body">These close to exhaustive rules should give the inexperienced or novice player the tools to be able to fully enjoy their post match festivities in their or someone else's students union/sports club bar. This has been written in the face the wrath of many a die-hard bunnies player, who would argue that the rules of the sacred game should never be written down, but learned only from hard experience and the fines associated with that. But in these days of mobile communications, the Internet, and the changing face of the student population, who seem less and less interested in the playing of such games as Bunnies, and more and more interested in not behaving in a loud obnoxious “lairy” manner in order to look “cool” and not upset their “real friends”, it's necessary to lay the rules down forever in the hope of a return of a more civilised age which may one day realise again the full potential of this most noble of games.<br /></p>
